# :globe_with_meridians: Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) Multi Application Project
A multi-form application for Malin Space Science Systems (MSSS) that will connect several clients with a remote server using Named Pipes from the Inter-Process Communication Technologies and runs the same version of the application at all locations. 

:dart: To run the project do the following:
1. Download project
2. Click on the server application and run the program
3. Go back to main directory and click Client Application
4. Run Client Application Program
5. Once the application is running you can select between three different language options (English, German, and French) and you can customize the UI by selcting different themes from the drop-down menu.

## H2 Project Description:

:pushpin: Malin Space Science Systems Console Application runs continuously on the main server and provides calculation services to clients connecting via a private network. The calculation services are provided through a custom third-party DLL with specific mathematical formula.

:white_small_square: A single client Windows Application connects to the server program using Named Pipes from the Inter-Process Communication technologies. 

:white_small_square: The client/server utilises the Windows Communications Foundation for communications between the Form client and Console server. 

:white_small_square: The client interface provides the user with input text boxes for each astronomical calculation and displays the returned values in read-only output text boxes. 

:white_small_square: Malin Space Science Systems has three major European operations and the teams at each of these locations can change the language during runtime which will change the language for all controls and labels. 

:white_small_square: The client application runs the same version of the application at all locations; the single client version is distributed and customisable for language and UI display.
